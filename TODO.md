# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Add support for other post types
* Shortcode support (its own shortcodes, and optionally other shortcodes specified by user)
* Fix for attempting to embed example 'code' within 'code' : `<code>Here is example <code>some_example();</code>.</code>`
* Add filters
* Add admin notice to post editor when visual mode is enabled to alert user that formatting may not be able to be preserved?
* Investigate being able to preserve formatting within visual editor? Or is that even worth it given block editor?

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/preserve-code-formatting/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/preserve-code-formatting/) as an issue or PR).
